        <h1>INTEGRATED LEARNING SYSTEM</h1>
        <h3>Everything you need to know about ILS</h3>



        <h1>What is <span class="orange-text">Integrated Learning System (ILS)</span></h1>
        <p>Right from the beginning, AOLCC has used the Integrated Learning System – a self-directed, multisensory
            learning experience – as its primary method of delivery. Rather than encouraging students to passively
            absorb skills and knowledge, ILS puts them in the driver’s seat of their learning experience. Students read,
            write, listen, practice, discuss, and create their way to achieving course outcomes. In addition, trained
            learning coaches provide personalized, just-in-time support and help learners master course content,
            discover effective study habits, manage test anxiety, and hone the professional skills they’ll need to
            succeed in the workplace.</p>

                    <p class="light-text">It’s hard to know where you’re going if you don’t have a destination already
                        in mind. That’s why each AOLCC course starts by showing you a map of where you’re going and what
                        you will achieve. You’ll truly know how far you’ve come by seeing yourself conquer one
                        <strong>Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-sensitive(SMART)</strong> goal
                        after another!</p>

                    <h3>MAXIMIZED INTERACTION</h3>
                    <p>Utilize every corner of your brain</p>
                    <p class="light-text">Tired of taking courses where all you do is passively turn the page? We are,
                        too! That’s why our ILS courses are created to maximize interaction, engage, and inspire.
                        Through interaction with media, workbooks, and practical exercises, ILS courses actively involve
                        students in their learning and motivate them to go further.</p>

                    <p>Achieve the best learning result</p>
                    <p class="light-text">ILS courses are filled with authentic exercises and tasks where you’ll apply
                        what you’ve learned – just like you would in the workplace when you start your new career.
                        Through ILS, you’ll gain the practical experience you need now rather than during your first few
                        months on the job.</p>
