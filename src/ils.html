    <h3>Everything you need to know about ILS</h3>



    <h1>What is <span class="orange">Integrated Learning System (ILS)</span></h1>
    <p>Right from the beginning, AOLCC has used the Integrated Learning System – a self-directed, multisensory learning experience – as its primary method of delivery. Rather than encouraging students to passively absorb skills and knowledge, ILS puts them in the driver’s seat of their learning experience. Students read, write, listen, practice, discuss, and create their way to achieving course outcomes. In addition, trained learning coaches provide personalized, just-in-time support and help learners master course content, discover effective study habits, manage test anxiety, and hone the professional skills they’ll need to succeed in the workplace.</p>
