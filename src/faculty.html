He began his journey in 2009, when he decided to upgrade his Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer designation that he had earned in 2000. He enrolled in the MCSE program at the Langley campus with the support of HRDC, knowing that this would open up new career opportunities for him. After graduating from the program, he had a chance to work as a Technical Learning Coach at the same campus during a vacation period. He enjoyed this experience so much that he later took on the role of providing internal technical support for a startup company with three locations and 75 employees.",
                "bio2": "Rods passion for learning and teaching did not stop there. He reached out to the Langley campus again, offering his services as a Learning Coach for both the Langley and Abbotsford campuses. Six months later, he moved to the Richmond campus, where he worked as a Learning Coach for eight years. During this time, he also completed various courses from other institutions, such as the First Nations University of Canada and Enriched Academy. In 2021, he returned to the Langley campus as a Technical Learning Coach, and eventually became the Head Learning Coach. Rods current role involves guiding students in their training endeavors and monitoring their progress. He finds great satisfaction in seeing students surpass their goals and overcome their challenges. Rod is a living testament to his dedication and remarkable growth within the organization.",
