            "Right from the beginning I knew I wanted to go to the Academy of Learning Career College. I had researched other colleges but the Admission Director was very welcoming, listened to my needs and provided me with the necessary information to make an informed choice of the career I wanted to pursue. I have learned so much from the Administrative Assistant diploma program with the excellent help and support from my facilitators. And on the top of that help, they have provided me with extra guidance and assistance in writing a professional resume and letter as well as providing me with job leads related to my goal. It is their enthusiasm to see me succeed that has kept me motivated."

            "After working for a firm for 28 years I was informed that they no longer needed my services. I was a mature worker and had tied myself to one job and one company for many years, so I was apprehensive about looking for a new job. After submitting
            many resumes, I realized that I was unable to meet the requirements of most employers. My years of experience no longer mattered. I needed to upgrade my skills to be marketable and competitive in today’s workforce. I decided on Academy of
            Learning Career College. The Facilitators were tremendous and always ready and able to help. I liked the idea of self-paced learning. I was able to complete some of the subjects quickly, and others were more challenging and required extra
            time and effort. In less than a year I graduated with an Honours diploma. I had a sense of accomplishment and felt very pleased with myself."

                    <p class="mb-0">After an accident at work, I was not able to go back to my job. It was suggested
                        to me to go back to school to retrain to do something that was going to work for me. After
                        not being in school for thirty plus years I was terrified
                        to start something new but the staff at Academy of Learning made the transition really easy
                        and if there was ever a concern I could ask for help right away. Academy of Learning gave me
                        the courage to keep going and complete
                        my goal of becoming a bookkeeper/accounting graduate. Thank you for being my cheer leading
                        section when I felt like I didn’t have one!</p>
