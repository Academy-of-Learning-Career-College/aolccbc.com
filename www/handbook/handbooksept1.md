# Our Training Philosophy

You will find when you begin your classes that the people who make up the student body come from a wide range of backgrounds. Each person brings a life experience that can and should be shared.

Your time at AOLCC will help you make the transition from your high school days, your homemaking days or your past job experiences to a new career. By the time you graduate, you will have acquired the technical skills and work habits that are required for employment success.

Our programs are designed not only to develop technical skills but also to develop the qualities that employers want, initiative, discipline, the ability to solve problems and to be able to work independently. For this reason, we intentionally create and foster an office-like environment in our classroom. Consequently, our codes of conduct, policies and regulations have been developed with the "employer-employee" relationship in mind.

In addition to the qualities listed above, employers want employees with great attitudes. Attitudes cannot be taught; they can only be refined. It is for this reason that we place much of the responsibility for your progress squarely on you.

# Government Registration, Licencing, and Trademarks

Each Academy of Learning&reg; Career College is registered and approved by the appropriate government body in the province in which it operates. In British Columbia, the [Private Training Institutions Branch (PTIB)](https://www.privatetraininginstitutions.gov.bc.ca/) of the Ministry of Advanced Education maintains the bylaw and regulations. Programs are not offered until appropriate approvals have been granted by PTIB and any governing body if required.

Each college is independently owned and operated and is an authorized user of our trademarks. In order to offer programs and use our trademarks, each college must meet and maintain the _Academy of Learning&reg; Career College â€“ Franchisor Office Standards of Operation_.

Applicants, who are not suitable, do not meet the entrance requirements, or who decide to pursue other training options may be referred to other resources or to an alternate training institution. If an applicant fails to meet Academy of Learning&reg; Career College's admissions requirements, they may not be enrolled at Academy of Learning&reg; Career College based on the Admissions Policy being waived.

If a student taking one or more individual courses wishes to enroll in a Diploma-level or Certificate-level program, the student must meet the program's Admissions Requirements.

## Financial Aid

Some students may be eligible for funding from Student Aid BC, WorkBC, or organizations for people with disabilities. As well, many banks offer students lines of credit. The admissions department can provide you with more information.

## International Students

An international student who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident must obtain an appropriate _Study Permit_, also referred to as a _Student Visa_, from their nearest Canadian Consulate, or Immigration Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) directly as appropriate. In the application to a Canadian Consulate or the IRCC for a _Study Permit_, the international student applicant will need to include the Designated Learning Institution number (DLI #) on the application form.

- TOEFL Paper based test â€“ Minimum score of 525 required.
- TOEFL Internet based test â€“ Overall minimum score of 80 required, with minimum scores of 20 in Writing, Reading, Listening and Speaking.
- IELTS â€“ Minimum overall band of 6.0, with no single test score below 5.5
- CAEL â€“ Minimum overall score of 60

Applicants may be required to undertake an English language entry examination prior to entering a Diploma program.

## English Proficiency

All courses provided by Academy of Learning&reg; Career College require an understanding of the English language. We are interested in your success at AOLCC, so English upgrading opportunities may be recommended before beginning your program.

## Work Experience/Field Placement

With the primary exception of a small selection of healthcare programs, Academy of Learning&reg; Career College Diplomas, Certificates and individual courses do not include Work Experience or Field Placement.

Where the college offers programs that include Work Experience or Field Placement, the suitability of the facility is based jointly on the decision of the college Director, Instructors and the suppliers of the specialty portions of the student's enrolled program of study, whose expertise and input is essential for the proper management of this segment of the programs.

Eligible students in healthcare related programs will receive a clinical placement in a "medical/administrative setting". Placements will be made based on the student's choice of program, host availability, and geographic location. Students must be prepared to work shifts and to travel a reasonable distance to their placement site.

To ensure that the placement site will provide a relevant work experience for the student, the original agreement outlines what the workplace will provide and what is expected of the student.

A staff person from the college will ensure that the work experience is relevant to the student learning and that the site and its environment are safe.

To participate in a clinical placement is a privilege for a student and there are expectations that appropriate work ethics will always be displayed. Final grading of the work experience is based on the final evaluation by the Host, and is rated as "Pass", "Fail" or "Honours'.

## Academic Exemption (Credit for Prior Learning â€“ CPL)

A former student of Academy of Learning&reg; Career College may be able to have credits from a previous course or program they have completed within the last 24 months applied to a new program. All qualified credits will be utilized in shortening the program and the tuition fees accordingly. These credits from a previous program will appear on the new transcript.

CPL may also be granted from other previous and related education, training, and/or work experience. Transcripts, related course outlines, employment portfolios or resumes must be submitted for individual assessment and review, during the admission process. These marks will also appear on the student's Academy of Learning&reg; Career College transcript.

_Note: If the document(s) provided does not contain a grade/percentage, or the level of proficiency cannot be determined, a passing mark of 75% will be given to the course(s) granted CPL. This review is at the sole discretion of the college._

The prospect student may also complete challenge examinations, which indicate acceptable levels of proficiency in specific skill areas. A charge will be applied for these examinations and a score of 75% or greater must be achieved to be considered for the credit. Challenge marks do appear on the student's Academy transcript. No textbooks, workbooks, or notes are issued for courses that were challenged.

Students wishing to enroll in the advanced level of a specific course within a career program must first write the test for the basic level. If the student achieves a passing mark of 75% or more, they may begin the next level of that course. Should the student not achieve a passing grade (75%) on the challenge exam, the course will have to be taken and the regular price.

Credits earned through either prior learning or challenges can qualify for only up to a maximum of 40% of the selected program.

Requests for challenge exams and/or any discussion regarding academic exemption must be arranged and concluded prior to starting classes. Approval for CPL is mandatory prior to the Diploma or Certificate being awarded.

Please discuss this with an Academy of Learning&reg; Career College admissions representative for details.

## Academic Probation

Most diploma programs require a 75% overall mark to graduate.

- Different programs may have different passing mark requirements. Please speak to your Learning Coach for course minimums for your program.

A student may be placed on academic probation if their cumulative average falls below the standard minimum of 75% or there is evidence of excessive lateness or problematic attendance.

While on probation, a student must show furthered commitment and effort towards their studies and attendance. Students on probation are expected to achieve a minimum grade of 75% for the duration of their probationary period and/or show significant improvement in attendance.

At the end of the probationary period, the student's performance or attendance will be reviewed. If the probationary requirements have been met, the student will be removed from active probation.

If the student does not meet the probationary requirements, the probationary period may not be extended, and the student withdrawn from the program.

A student wishing to appeal the determination must do so in writing explaining why the student deserves further consideration.

_Note: we_ _always_ _recommend seeking advice from your Learning Coach or other staff member when you are having trouble. It is much easier to assist right away and not let the issue(s) become overwhelming._

## Mitigating Circumstances

The college reserves the right to make exceptions on a discretionary basis to any of its policies actions based on specific mitigating circumstances, which may exist regarding students. If the college determines that mitigating circumstances prevent students from meeting any of the administrative standards or criteria, alternative arrangements for meeting these standards or criteria can be made on an individual basis by the Director.

## Attendance Policy

The Academy of Learning&reg; Career College's flexibility allows you to work at your own pace. You may select the hours of attendance that suit your circumstances, but this is subject to workstation availability and within the college's hours of operation. The minimum weekly hours you wish to attend is considered and agreed to at the time of enrollment. However, this is subject to the program's registration as set out by the ministry and your funding source. You may put in additional hours before your end dates providing arrangements have been made to reserve a workstation for this purpose.

No refund of tuition will be given for occasional absences from classes. The student is obligated to complete the program of study within the time frame determined as the end date and the college's guidelines for completing individual courses. During the term of the contract, a student's progress is evaluated, and changes may be considered and recommended to adjust for the pace of the student, and his or her attendance and progress requirements.

Regular attendance is not only a good habit, it is also important in terms of your professional growth. In addition, there is often a direct relationship between regular attendance and academic success. A permanent record of your attendance will be kept.

Please give as much advance notice as you can, if you are unable to attend class. You may be placed on probation or dismissed if there is a record of excessive absenteeism. If you are receiving financial aid, please see the [Student Aid BC Loan Requirements section](#student-aid-bc-loan-requirements), and [Other Funding Sources section](#other-funding-sources) for specific details regarding their attendance requirements. We encourage you to clarify any questions with the Admissions Representative at your campus.

## Attendance Records

Each day you attend the college, when you come in and when you leave for the day, you must record your attendance on the school's _attendance computer_ located near the reception. You will be shown how to log in and log out on your first day of class. As these records are confidential, you must not share your user identity and password with anyone. For accuracy, please ensure you are assigning your time in class to the course(s) you are working on.

Students found to be logging in for or by another student in the attendance computer will be subject to the following for BOTH students;

- Receive a verbal warning
- Receive a written warning which will outline future consequences for repeat offenses and be put on Academic Probation
- Be dismissed for subsequent offenses

The attendance records are required for reporting purposes. Please note these records are part of your permanent file and are subject to audit by the government, sponsoring agencies or their designated agents.

## Breaks

Students must treat their training as they would an employment situation. As in any job, you are required to "watch the clock" when you take lunch or coffee breaks. A 15-minute, mid-morning or midafternoon coffee break is usually given at work, so get used to this now and ensure you return to class promptly. If a student requires an extended break, he/she must obtain permission from the Learning Coach or Instructor and _must log out_ when leaving and log in upon returning to class. If a student fails to notify the college staff, the Learning Coaches or Instructors have the authority to log you out from the attendance computer, or deduct time from your daily attendance, to ensure the accuracy of your attendance records.

## Hours of Attendance

Class hours for Learning Coach or Instructor-led classes will be at the sole discretion of the college. You will be required to attend the classes according to the timetable set by the college. Students are responsible for making up the time they miss, and for arranging to collect any handouts or notes. If you have questions about the hours of operation at your campus, simply ask a Learning Coach.

A student may be placed on probation if the college believes the student has abused any part of the attendance policy. If the problem(s) persists after being placed on probation, a student may be dismissed. A student will be given every chance to remedy his/her situation. A verbal warning and a written warning will be issued before a student is dismissed for a violation of the attendance policy. Please refer to the complete DISMISSAL/EXPULSION POLICY beginning on Page 19 of this handbook.

### Student Commitment

All students are required to demonstrate a commitment to their studies and to progress at a satisfactory rate. There are minimum standards which all students must meet:

- Meet your minimum weekly hours;
- Complete all assignments, projects, and homework;
- Submit all quizzes, tests, mid-terms and final exams on time;
- Obtain a minimum of 60% in each course; Note: The minimum mark may vary by program.
- Maintain a minimum overall average of 75% in a registered diploma program or registered certificate program; Note: Marks may vary by registered diploma program or registered certificate program
- Obtain a minimum mark of 75% on each individual certificate course.

You can demonstrate commitment in your studies by:

- Attending all scheduled classes;
- Coming to class on time;
- Being prepared (_homework or reading may be required depending on the program);_
- Being an active student, by listening, doing and completing each task assigned;
- Working on assigned work during class time;

- Participating actively (with a good attitude) in labs, classes and clinical placements;
- Remaining in class for the full, scheduled time each day;
- Seeking help when you need it (e.g. academic, financial and budgeting advice and career guidance); Remaining in good academic standing.

These are just a few examples. Should you have any concerns about whether you are meeting your obligations, speak to your Learning Coach, Instructor, or director of the college.

## Student Aid BC Loan Requirements

To stay eligible for Student Aid BC loans or grants, you must attend school full-time\* for the entire study period for which you have received funding.

_\*Full-time is at least 60% of the full course load (40% for students with permanent disabilities) for at least 12 consecutive weeks. At AOLCC, it translates to minimum weekly hours of 20, or more, varies by programs._

If you stop attending classes, drop below your required course load, or fail to maintain the minimum number of weekly instructional hours for workshops/clinical placements for your entire study period, but you do not formally withdraw from school, you may still be considered withdrawn for student assistance purposes.

You will be considered withdrawn if:

- You miss two consecutive weeks or 10 instructional days of study (no attendance), or
- You drop below 60% of a full-time course load for three consecutive weeks of study, or
- You miss 20% of the program of study in total, or
- You miss enough classes that school officials feel you cannot successfully complete the program

The college is required to report students' attendance to Student Aid BC and will report the student as withdrawn if the above conditions are met.

If you withdraw from school two times while receiving B.C. student financial assistance, you will be denied further funding by Student Aid BC.

## Other Funding Sources

Please be advised that every funding agency has their own set of requirements regarding minimum attendance. These requirements will be reviewed with you by your funder and again at the time you enroll. If you do not maintain your attendance, the college is required to advise your funding agency. You may then be assumed to have withdrawn, your program cancelled and may be expected to return all or a portion of your payments. Should you require further clarification, please speak to the Admissions Department or the Campus Director.

The college provides attendance record and progress reports on a periodic basis to sponsoring agencies, if required, on behalf of students. This lets the college, the student, and the agency know if the student is behind or ahead of schedule.

Please note that attendance and progress records may be subject to scrutiny by sponsoring agencies and are maintained by the college as prescribed.

 ## Learning from Home / Hybrid Learning
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Academy of Learning&reg; Career College  has updated its Integrated Learning System&reg; (ILS&reg;) to allow for Learning from Home and Hybrid Learning.
Hybrid Learning is a combination of Learning from Home and Learning on Campus.

The advantage of Learning from Home is that you can access your courses and even the final exams from home using the same myAOLCC Learning Hub that you use at the campus. 

Regular attendance is still required. However, Learning from Home allows you to spread your hours across all 7 days instead of just Monday to Friday. And you can work on your courses in the evening, after the kids have gone to bed.

While working from home, you still have the same support that you get at the campus during regular campus hours.
If you have any questions outside of the campus hours, you can send an email to your Learning Coach or leave a voicemail, and a qualified learning coach will return your message during the next school day.

### Software and Hardware Requirements
In order to complete your courses from home, there are certain technical requirements that must be met. <br>
These requirements may change at any point. If you are unsure, please ask your learning coach. 

_Note: These requirements are only for Learning from Home. All Academy of Learning&reg; Career College campuses are equipped with the hardware and software required to complete your courses._

#### Minimum Requirements
|||
|---|---|
|Operating System | Microsoft Windows 8.1 or 10 |
|Screen Size | 14 inches |
|Keyboard | 104 key keyboard |
|Internet | Wifi - 1.5 Mbps or faster |
|Optional | Office 365 Personal |

_Note: Depending on the courses you are enrolled in, you might be able to use other types of computers. Please speak with Admissions or a Learning Coach before purchasing a computer specifically for school._

### Exams
If you wish to take your exam at home, you will need to reach out to the campus to get an exam code in order to unlock the exam. There may also be certain technical requirements, so please speak with your learning coach before your exam date to ensure you have what you need. <br>
Please ensure you request the code *before* your target exam date if you wish to take the exam outside of normal campus hours.

### Keyboard Skill Building Exams
If you are unable to come into the campus to take the Keyboard Skill Building exam, you are able to submit your progress report in order to receive credit for the course. 
Please speak with your learning coach for more details.

## Programs or Course Changes

Every request for a diploma program or course change will be considered, provided you have discussed the feasibility of the change with the Campus Director. You will be asked to provide a written request outlining your reasons and how this change will help you achieve your career goals. If your request is approved, you will be required to complete a new registration contract.

Students that are sponsored must obtain written permission from their sponsoring agency and submit it with their written request for a course change.

_Any or all of the courses which you have completed, may be applied to the new diploma program (CPL; see the [Academic Exemption (Credit for Prior Learning â€“ CPL) _section](#academic-exemption-credit-for-prior-learning--cpl)), provided they are listed on the new diploma selection list._

_You should be aware that any changes to your program after you commence classes may affect your sponsorship or student loan funding. Check with_ our admissions department, _the Financial Aid Office_, _or your sponsor before you reach your final decision._

## Interruption and Resumption of Studies

Any prolonged period of non-attendance from scheduled classes for more than 5 days constitutes an interruption. The college will notify the sponsoring agencies and/or student loan providers after 5 days of absenteeism (or sooner, depending on the agency's policy).

If, for any reason, you must interrupt your studies, but wish to return to them later, please ensure that you follow the appropriate procedure to obtain a leave of absence. Contact the Campus Director at your college for this purpose. Also, please note that an interruption may affect your eligibility for further funding. Check with the Campus Director or your sponsor for more information regarding your interruption of studies.

If you did obtain a leave of absence, and are ready to resume your studies later, you must decide through the Campus Director as soon as you are sure of your return date. Your new start date will depend upon seating and equipment availability.

If a leave of absence was not granted, or you were not in good financial or academic standing at the time you interrupted your studies, you may apply to resume studies by submitting a written request. This written request must explain any reasons and/or mitigating circumstances which prevented you from obtaining a leave of absence. You will be advised of the final decision, and should you be re-admitted, you may be advised of any conditions that you must meet.

## Transfer Policy

Students are expected to complete their program of study at the Academy of Learning&reg; Career College identified on their contract. Under no circumstances can course or program registrations be transferred to another individual.

If you wish to transfer to another Academy of Learning&reg; Career College, you must request this in writing from our campus in advance, but we cannot guarantee that a transfer will be made. Transfers will only be considered if the student is in good standing and are at the sole discretion of the campus director. This policy may be subject to approval from your funding agency and is subject to space availability and acceptance by the campus to which you want to transfer.

Academy of Learning&reg; Career College wishes to confirm its responsibility to provide a safe and secure learning environment. At Academy of Learning&reg; Career College, we firmly believe that there should be a safe environment for all the students, which is free from any kind of sexual misconduct as the college has zero tolerance towards this kind of misconduct. 

Through this policy the institutions strive to prevent sexual misconduct and create a procedure to respond effectively and in a timely manner when incidents occur. 

In 2016 the Government of BC introduced the Sexual Violence and Misconduct Policy Act S.B.C. c.23 (the Act). The Act requires BC post secondary institutions to establish, implement, and make publicly available a policy, with associated procedures, that addresses sexual misconduct, its prevention, and responses to sexual misconduct. This Policy has been designed in compliance with the Act.

### Scope and Application
The policy applies to students, faculty and staff members working at Academy of Learning&reg; Career College as well as extends to the visitors, volunteers and contractors at the campus, who may be found involved in any act of violating the respectful environment of the college by indulging in any sexual violence or misconduct.

Sexual misconduct is defined as any form of undesired activity of a sexual nature which intends to violate the sexual integrity of the individual to whom it is directed. Sexual assault is characterized by a broad range of behaviors that involve the use of coercion, threats or control towards a person which makes the person feel uncomfortable, distressed, frightened.

2. To initiate a formal process, the victim or a member of the college community, on behalf of the victim, needs to submit a report in writing to the Executive Director/ Senior Educational Administrator of Academy of Learning&reg; Career College, stating as clearly as possible the details of the incident, including the details of the people involved in the misconduct, along with a request for an action.

6. The person against whom allegations are made will be informed about the same, keeping the name and details of the complainant private. The person will be given 24 hoursâ€™ time to submit written explanation about the incident.

### Harassment or Discrimination

If you have good reason to believe you are being harassed:

- Ask the offender to stop: As harassment is often unintentional, asking to stop the behavior often puts an end to the harassment. The best way to deal with it is to assertively tell the person(s) that their behavior is unwelcome or offensive and must stop.
- Seek assistance: If the person persists in the behavior that you deem to be harassing, seek assistance by reporting the incident to the Director. The company harassment policy will become effective.

# Tests and Final Examinations

There are usually two components to exams: A Practical Pre-test which tests your practical knowledge of the course and must be looked at by a Learning Coach before you may proceed. Secondly, an Online Multiple-choice Exam - which tests your theoretical knowledge.

These exams are normally scheduled for the last day of the course. Practical tests must also be completed before the final examination.

Additional in-class tests or quizzes are left to the discretion of the Learning Coach or Instructor. You will receive your results almost immediately, along with feedback on areas that may need further review.

Learning Coach or Instructor will advise you on your exam dates. Depends on the course, if you have completed the study material ahead of schedule, you are encouraged to advise the Learning Coach that you wish to take your exam early.

## Exam Procedures

1. One day before the exam, please speak to a Learning Coach. He/she will help you understand what is expected in the exam and prepare your exam in advance.
2. If applicable, textbooks, workbooks, notebooks, and related study materials must be handed in. Unless otherwise stated, all exams are closed book. The study materials also include, but not limited to electronic documents, web search results, online video/audio files, etc. You may use your computer or program built-in Help function and test your answers with the relevant program.
3. Do not remove Practical Pre-test from their covers and do not mark the covers of the exam pages.
4. You may ask questions during an exam regarding the interpretation of exam questions. Answers will be limited to only those questions which pertain to interpretation of the exam questions.
5. You may not ask Learning Coaches to check your answers prior submitting to Head Office.
6. You may not ask another student(s) for help. If another student(s) wishes to offer help during your exam, please respectfully decline.
7. You are not allowed to leave the classroom during an exam. You may leave once the examination session is finished, and when you have submitted the exam. In case of emergencies, the college will interrupt the exam.
8. No time extensions will be given on a test or exam. All tests and exams must be completed within the official time allotted. Unless approved by a Director, all exams must be completed and submitted the same day. No additional time will be given for a test or exam if the student is late.
9. You are responsible to schedule enough time to complete your exams in advance. Online Multiple-Choice Exams must be started 3 hours before closing time; therefore, if the campus closes at 5:00pm, then no exams should be started after 2:00pm. If a course has a Practical Pre-test, it must be complete before the Online Multiple-Choice Exam. In the above example, you may need to start your exam at 1:00pm.
1. If you are absent for a test or exam without enough reason, you will receive a grade of zero. If you had special circumstances, a letter outlining the reasons must be submitted to the campus director within three business days of the examination date. If your appeal is approved, only one date will be arranged for a make-up test/exam. Failure to write a make-up test/exam as scheduled will result in a grade of zero, which is not open to appeal.
2. Should any examination be cancelled due to extreme weather conditions, alternate arrangements will be made by the college to reschedule the examination.
3. If a student is caught cheating, their exam will be confiscated and submitted incomplete to Head Office for marking. If Head Office or the campus determines that a student has cheated on an exam, the matter will be further investigated. Depending on the circumstances, the student may fail the exam and suspension from the program or expulsion from the centre will be considered.

Learning Coaches/Instructors reserve the right to refuse an exam to a student if they believe;
1. The student has not achieved the necessary proficiency in the program to pass the exam.
2. The student lacks the necessary time required to write the exam.
3. The student has not done the necessary review to successfully complete a rewrite of an exam.
4. The student is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

## Exam Passing Marks

Academic requirements for all approved diploma and certificate programs require a minimum final exam mark of 60% in any one subject, while maintaining an overall average of 75%. Students achieving a mark of 90% and higher will pass their course(s) with Honors. A mark below 60% will automatically require a rewrite.

You must ensure that your overall average is acceptable. If your average falls below 75%, you may be asked to stop taking new courses and rewrite exams to bring your average up.

As for individual courses, you must achieve a 75% mark or greater for a single course for an individual Certificate to be awarded.

## Exam Re-writes

If a student receives a mark between 60% and 74% on a subject, one rewrite is permitted without charge. After one rewrite, a $30 fee will apply to future rewrites. In any rewrites, the total mark available will be a maximum of 89%.This is because a rewrite is not considered honors.

Academy of Learning&reg; Career College develops examinations to test the student's knowledge or ability to use the skills they have learned. Should the student fail at the second attempt(s), he/she will need to repeat the course; however, regular fees will apply.

## Exam Appeal Policy

Academy of Learning&reg; Career College has established an exam appeal procedure for a reassessment of a student's exam. When the Director, Learning Coach or the student queries a question or feels that a question on an exam was marked incorrectly, according to the courseware studied, the Director or Learning Coach, if they agree that the student's claim is legitimate, will submit a Petition to the Help Desk.

Help Desk is a method for college staff to communicate with the Academic Division of LaunchLifeâ„¢ International Inc. If there is a Petition with any of the Online Multiple-Choice exams, attention is immediately drawn to the problem question. Wording of the question as well as the selection of responses are reviewed and re-assessed. If the Petition is successful, marks are adjusted to compensate the student accordingly. If a Petition is unsuccessful, an explanation will be provided to validate both the question and the correct answer(s).

If a grade appeal is raised by a student enrolled in third-party program, the Learning Coach can contact the Academic Division of LaunchLifeâ„¢ International Inc. via the Help Desk using the Course Query function. The Academic Division reviews the student's appeal and will direct it to the appropriate third-party provider. Subsequently, the third-party provider will review the appeal, will decide, and will then report back to the Academic Division. The final decision of the grade appeal will be reported back to the Learning Coach by way of the Academic Division.

## Academic Dishonesty

Academic Dishonesty, such as cheating, copying, plagiarism, collaboration, on assignments, tests or exams will not be tolerated. Any student caught acting dishonestly will face the following penalties:

1. First offence: zero on the assignment, test, or exam
2. Second offence: expulsion

_Detailed explanation of each act are listed under [Academic fraud](#academic-fraud) â€“ It could be deemed as any action or deed, performed alone or with others, for the unfair advantage or benefit of themselves or others, or use of any word or phrase that could be construed as fraud, including:_

## Protecting Academic Integrity

All students and staff are responsible for protecting the academic integrity of the college. This is best done through preventing and stopping academic dishonesty. Here are some ways to achieve this:

## Time Management

- Enter major tests and project due dates on a calendar.
- Record daily homework, minor assignments and readings. A pocket-sized notebook is perfect.

- Keep reference material and supplies handy.
- Eliminate distractions such as cellphones, radios, and TV.

## Study Strategies

- Study every day.
- Set a definite time limit. The length of time you need for studying depends on you and your goals. No two students are identical.
- Do "One Thing at a Time", that is, either listen OR write OR read, etc. Do not attempt to listen and read OR listen and type at the same time.
- Highlight key sentences and write notes in your books will help you review effectively.
- Review each lesson quickly. Get the overview and then tackle any details and difficulties.
- Review relevant textbook sections or chapter and make use of all other resources available.
- Allow for brief breaks of 5 to 10 minutes if studying for a long period of time.
- Know the examination format â€“ essay questions, short answer, multiple choice, etc.
- Reinforce what you learn in class by:
- Writing summaries in outline form,
- Reciting material aloud without referring to notes,
- Telling someone what you have learned,
- Testing your answers with flashcard question and answer items.

Listen to the Learning Coach's or Instructor's tips on what will be emphasized. Never assume something won't be included on a test or exam unless told so specifically.

Certain courses count these review questions towards your mark for the course.

If these questions are on the computer, you can check the answer keys after completing them. If they are in the workbooks, you can ask the Learning Coaches the location the Answer Binder, which contains the answer keys.
